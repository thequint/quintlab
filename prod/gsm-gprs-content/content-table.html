            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GPRS is mainly designed for data download, whereas meter data is uploaded. GPRS bandwidth reduces to a quarter on upload</td>

            <tr>
                <td>GSM/GPRS is highly unreliable in rural areas. Meters are permanently fixed devices and power availability to mobile towers may vary, leading to skewed information</td>
                <td>The advantages of RF reliability and low cost become more prominent in rural areas, but there is no distinct disadvantage in urban areas</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GSM/GPRS connections are highly susceptible to call drops, and reconnection time is nearly 20 seconds</td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Since the GSM/GPRS card is always in communication mode, the power consumption is huge–more than 10 times that of the nearest comparable technology. A mobile phone balances between talk time and standby time, which is not the case with meters. For the 200 million meters that must be replaced, the power requirement will go up by nearly 240 MW</td>
                <td>Negligible power requirement</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>To address the issue of tampering, the modem needs to be sealed inside the meter. If GPRS technology gets outdated (which is likely as it is a very inefficient use of available bandwidth), all meters will again have to be replaced</td>
