                <td>GSM/GPRS connections are highly susceptible to call drops, and reconnection time is nearly 20 seconds</td>

                <td>Since the GSM/GPRS card is always in communication mode, the power consumption is huge–more than 10 times that of the nearest comparable technology. A mobile phone balances between talk time and standby time, which is not the case with meters. For the 200 million meters that must be replaced, the power requirement will go up by nearly 240 MW</td>
