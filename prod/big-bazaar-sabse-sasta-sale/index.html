Held around Republic Day, Sabse Saste Din spans multiple days and promises you the best deals across a spectrum of products at the right prices.

          <p>Before we tell you the story of how it all started, here’s a look at the top-selling products from last year’s Sabse Saste Din. The parallels are sure to boggle your mind!</p>

        <p>Around the year 2000, the concept of a ‘supermarket’ was still considered to be a very western idea.
              Most people had only read about it and maybe watched it in American sitcoms. It was at the
              local kirana store that most Indians shopped for their grocery and other household items. And then
              in 2001, something happened. The retail space witnessed a massive disruption, the magnitude of
              which remains unrivalled till date. India had got its first Big Bazaar store in Kolkata, and in no time,
              people discovered the delights of shopping while walking through aisles, navigating their trolleys and
              choosing between more brands than they could imagine. The best part was that the prices of the
              products were no different from what they got at their favourite kirana stores. In a lot of cases, they
              were in fact cheaper.</p>

            </span> <br>
        <p>With Big Bazaar, the ‘supermarket experience’ had not only arrived in India, but had also gone
              mainstream. It was only a matter of time then that Big Bazaar came to dominate the brick-and-
              mortar retail space with stores spread across India. And mind you, this was just the proverbial tip of
              the iceberg. In 2006, they had their first ever Republic Day Sale and this event, completely changed
              the way India shopped.</p>

        <p>The Republic Day sale, that has over the years come to be known as Sabse Saste Din, gave Indians all
              that they were looking for – lowest prices on their favourite products, a sale spanning multiple days
              and most importantly, the supermarket experience. India gave it a thumbs up and how. During the
              first such sale, the footfalls at Big Bazaar’s Lower Parel outlet were so high that cops had to be called
              in. Ever since, Sabse Saste Din has only come to be associated with mind-boggling numbers – crores
              of people visiting Big Bazaar stores during the sale, lakhs and lakhs of items sold and revenues
              earned to the tune of hundreds of crores. This happens unfailingly, year on year. It’s no exaggeration
              then to say that Sabse Saste Din can be credited with taking India’s relationship with shopping to a
              new level altogether.</p>
        <p> It’s as if the whole country is out there shopping during those days, and why not? Right from
              stocking your kitchen to getting yourself a wardrobe makeover and shopping for your next holiday,
              you can pretty much do everything once you’ve walked into a Big Bazaar. Shopping was never
              considered to be a family excursion, but Sabse Saste Din changed that perception. Today Big Bazaar
              is a hit with families because it has something for each member. </p>

              the customer an enhanced experience year on year. </p>

        <p>Along the way, Sabse Saste Din spawned many similar ‘sales’ from competing retailers, but its popularity remains uncontested. Talk about the first mover advantage. In many ways, it’s a trendsetter and has owned the period around Republic Day, so much so that people look forward to it every year as though it’s a festival. People flock to their nearest Big Bazaar store, serpentine queues and insane crowds notwithstanding. What started off as a 1-2 day event has now morphed into a shopping carnival that lasts nearly a week, thanks to the overwhelming response it has been receiving from consumers. Given that it happens in January, Sabse Saste Din sets the tone for similar such ‘sales’ for the rest of the year by other retail players. </p>
        <p> Like any other festival, preparations for this one too start months in advance. Each and every person working in every Big Bazaar store across India strives to make Sabse Saste Din special for you – the consumer. And the enthusiasm levels are as though they’re prepping up for a family wedding. This video gives you wonderful glimpse into the passion that goes behind every Sabse Saste Din and the heroes that make it possible. </p>
