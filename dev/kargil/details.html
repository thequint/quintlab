				<h2 class="article-headline"><span>Padmapani Acharya</span></h2>
				<div class="article-text">
					<a class="btn-goback" href="index.html#destination">Go Back</a>
					<h3 class="article-sub-headline">Background</h3>
					<p><strong>Rank: </strong>Major<br>
					    <strong>Regiment: </strong>2 Rajputana Rifles<br>
						<strong>Awards: </strong>Maha Vir Chakra (Posthumous)
					</p>
					<p>Major Padmapani Acharya was an officer in the Indian Army’s 2 Rajputana Rifles. Originally from Odisha, he was a resident of Hyderabad, Telangana. He joined the Indian Army in 1994.</p> 

<p>On 21 June 1999, his family consisting of his six-month pregnant wife, brother and parents celebrated his birthday at home. One week later, on 28 June 1999, in the battalion attack on Tololing by the 2nd Rajputana Rifles, Major Acharya as a Company Commander was given the task of capturing a heavily fortified enemy bunker, strongly held with minefields and machine gun and artillery fire. Tololing was a dominant position overlooking the Srinagar-Leh Highway; its successful capture would have been pivotal to India winning the Kargil war.</p> 

<p>Unfortunately, the troop suffered a large number of casualties due to heavy artillery attack by Pakistan in the early stages itself. But this did not stop Major Acharya. He went forward with the mission leading the reserve platoon, unmindful of his own safety. Some of his men were injured, but he encouraged them to keep moving towards their goal. He himself crawled up to the enemy bunker and threw several grenades at them. When he was gravely injured, he commanded his men to leave him and continue the attack on the enemy; he too continued firing. After a whole night of intense hand-to-hand battle, 2 Rajputana Rifles succeeded in recapturing Tololing, turning the course of the Kargil war. Unfortunately, Major Acharya succumbed to his injuries soon after.</p> 
 
<p>Back home, his family was given the news and told that Major Acharya “fought bravely. He created history but he is no more".</p>

					<h3 class="article-sub-headline">Where is his family now? </h3>
<p>Major Acharya’s father, Jagannath Acharya is a former wing commander of the Indian Air Force. He fought the 1965 and 1971 wars with Pakistan. After his retirement in 1991, he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation. He passed away on 29 December 2017. Major Acharya’s mother, Vimala was a social worker until very recently till her health and age permitted. </p>

<p>His brother, Padmasambhav Acharya, fondly called Dubloo,  is also in the Indian Army and was a captain during the Kargil war.  He is now a Colonel. Major Acharya’s two sisters are happily married and settled in Hyderabad. </p>

<p>Charulatha, Major Acharya’s now 45-year-old wife, is a housewife and proprietor of the Indane (Indian Oil) gas agency that the government awarded to the family. She has continued to live with her in-laws ever since major Acharya was martyred. The baby girl who was born a few months after he died, was named Aparajita (undefeated). She is now 18 years old and studies at Symbiosis Law College.</p>

				<h2 class="article-headline"><span>Saurabh Kalia</span></h2>
				<div class="article-text">
					<a class="btn-goback" href="index.html#destination">Go Back</a>
					<h3 class="article-sub-headline">Background</h3>
					<p><strong>Rank: </strong>Lieutenant, promoted to Captain posthumously<br>
						<strong>Regiment: </strong>4th Battalion, Jat Regiment</p>
					<p>Captain Saurabh Kalia was born in Amritsar in 1976 and completed his entire education till graduation in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. At the young age of 21 and standing at 6 feet 2 inches, he joined the Indian Military Academy in 1997. He was almost immediately posted in the 4 JAT Regiment (Infantry) in the Kargil Sector which he joined in January 1999.</p>
					
					<p>Trouble was already brewing. In the last fortnight of May 1999, Captain Saurabh went out on Patrol duty thrice. He is hailed as the first office to provide detailed intelligence about Pakistan’s large-scale intrusion into Kargil.</p>
					
					<p>The fourth time Patrol Duty came up, Captain Saurabh volunteered to go in place of another slightly older officer. With five other soldiers, he went to Bajrang Post at the height of 14,000 feet in the Kaksar area where his group faced heavy firing from the Pakistan army. They returned fire and held their posts until they ran out of ammunition and their signal equipment went out of order. They were captured on 15 May 1999 and kept in captivity for twenty two days without informing India about their Prisoner of War status. When Pakistan returned their bodies on 9 June, it was clear that they had been brutally tortured: broken teeth and bones, punctured eyes, cigarette burns, chopped off limbs and finally a fatal gun wound. But they didn’t give in and reveal any information that was demanded of them. </p>
					
					<p>Captain’s Saurabh’s parents never got the opportunity to actually see him in a uniform since he was sent to war so soon after training. He became a martyr before his last salary arrived in his bank account, before he could see himself become a Captain. He gave his life in what came to be known as Operation Vijay, named after his mother, Vijay Kalia. His last words to this mother before going to Kargil were: <em><strong>“Maa, tum dekhna. Ek din aisa kaam kar jaoonga ki saari duniya mein mera naam hoga.”</strong></em> (Maa, you see, one day I will do such a deed that the whole world will know my name).</p>

					<h3 class="article-sub-headline">Where is his family now? </h3>
					<p>Saurabh’s family of three still lives in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, twenty years since they received this letter. His 70-year-old father, Dr N K Kalia retired as a senior scientist in the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research at the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology. His mother, Mrs Vijaya is a 66-year-old homemaker. Saurabh’s brother, whose school examinations he inquires about in his letter, has since then passed school and college and now works as a software engineer at the Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University. </p>
					<p>For the past nineteen years, Dr Kalia has been fighting for justice for his son. He feels that the torture and murder of his son should be declared a war crime by the United Nations. He has been garnering massive support for his online petition urging the Indian government to take Pakistan to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for their actions. The case is also pending in the Supreme Court of India. </p>

				<h2 class="article-headline"><span>Vijayant Thapar</span></h2>
				<div class="article-text">
					<a class="btn-goback" href="index.html#destination">Go Back</a>
					<h3 class="article-sub-headline">Background</h3>
					<p><strong>Rank: </strong>Captain<br>
						<strong>Regiment:</strong> 2 Rajputana Rifles<br>
						<strong>Awards:</strong> Vir Chakra (Posthumous) 
					</p>
					<p>Vijayant Thapar was born into an Army family. His great-grandfather, his grandfather and his father all served in the Indian Army, so it was easy for him to decide what he wanted to do in life. From a young age, he would take his father’s peak cap, his cane and march around like a soldier. One of his parents’ earliest memories is of him running around in the garden with their two dogs, chasing butterflies and doing mock charges on friendly langoors. Vijayant worked hard to realise this dream and was eventually selected for the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun.</p>

<p>He was commissioned on 12 December 1998 and joined the 2 Rajputana Rifles at Gwalior. After several counter terrorist operations, his unit was ordered to move to Drass to capture Tololing, Tiger Hill and adjoining heights. On 28 June, 2 Rajputana Rifles was given the task of capturing Tololing, Three Pimples, Knoll and Lone Hill area.</p> 

<p>Again, Pakistan had all the advantages: a full moon night, strongly prepared positions, one narrow ridge, precipitous slopes on both sides, ravines thousands of feet deep, no cover and almost vertical climbs at places. The attack began and soon there was intense artillery shelling and enemy fire. Still, he, along with his troop, continued to move through a ravine towards their destination. At 8 PM that night, 120 guns opened fire. Undeterred, Captain Thapar led his team into this inferno. Somehow, the company secured a foothold on Knoll. Around this time, Captain Thapar heard the news of his company commander Major P Acharya being killed in the Battle of Tololing. This angered him like no other and along with his colleague Naik Tilak Singh, he starting engaging with the enemy from as close as 15 meters. He fought against two machine guns directly firing at him for an hour and a half after which he decided to move up and kill the enemy from closer range. Just then, a burst of fire struck him and he fell into the arms of Tilak Singh.  He was only 22-years-old.</p> 

<p>After this, his men charged ahead and fully captured Knoll, giving the Indian Army yet another of its decisive victories in the Kargil War.

					<p>Colonel V N Thapar, Vijayant’s father retired after serving in the army for 37 years the same year as Vijayant was commissioned: 1999. His mother, Tripta Thapar is a housewife who till this date makes Vijayan’t favourite dish, kheer, each year on his birthday. His aged parents now live in Noida. </p>
