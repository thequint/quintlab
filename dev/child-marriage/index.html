		<h1 class="quintlab-story__header--headline">Married Before 18</h1>
		<p>Rajasthan has the highest number of child marriages in India. Despite the practice being banned in the country since 1929, 51.2 per cent of women in Rajasthan aged between 20-25 were married off before the age of 18. This jeopardises the future of the young girls and endangers their health. Despite this practice being prevalent, Rajasthan dominated headlines in 2017 with massive protests over the release of the film 'Padmaavat', that was accused of "disrespecting Rajput honour".</p>

                        <h2 class="quintlab-details__content--headline">A child bride’s struggle with sarees</h2>

                        <p>Many an Indian girl will remember playing with their mother's sarees when they were young. But for Usha*, dressing up in the 4-metre long, one-metre wide traditional garment was anything but fun. She was only four years old when she was forced into marriage. Wearing the saree was her majboori, an obligation, she says. As a child bride in a village in Rajasthan, she was expected to wear it.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
                        	<blockquote> “Mujhe saree pehnna pasand nahi. Aisa lagta hai mujhe kisi ne bandha hua hai. I hate wearing sarees. I feel like I am being tied up.”</blockquote>
                        </div>
                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-first-2.jpg" alt=""></div>

                        <p>It was only when she turned eight that Usha found out she was married.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--iframe">
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfbrPm5yYBE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                        	<blockquote>“I don’t remember how I got married and I did not know who I was married to. My family would talk about how I was married to this man. But I did not understand what marriage was until I grew up”.</blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>Usha and her friends sneaked into her husband's village to catch a glimpse of him. She says she found him to be good looking. “Humein bade Handsome lage.” Her husband, now 23, is a science teacher at a private school.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
                        	<blockquote>“He is a nice man. He tells me I should study. He wants me to study and has told me that I can study as much as I want.”</blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>Usha studies Arts at a government-run school, 30 kilometres away from Rani Padmavati’s Chittorh. She turned 18 this year – the legal age to marry in India. A light-brown school uniform and dupatta cover her lean frame, as she stretches out a pencil-thin arm to draw a line of vermillion on her forehead. She never forgets to wear vermillion, the traditional sign of a married woman. She is conscious about her body language and careful with her words. She even laughs with hesitation.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-first-1.jpg" alt=""></div>

                        <p>A year ago, she moved in with her husband's family. She was only 17. A schoolgirl with far too many responsibilities – a regular day in her life involves cooking, washing dishes, cleaning the house and attending to her in-laws. She wakes up at 4 am to cook for the four members of the household before she can leave for school. It is only when she has a moment to spare that she sits down to finish her school homework. Things get tougher when exams are around the corner, she says, adding that marriage is a big obstacle to her education.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
                        	<blockquote>“They have ruined my life. I get very angry sometimes. When I complain, I'm told that the household chores simply must be completed”. “Kaam toh karne padega,” she says, helplessly.</blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>Tears well up as she talks about how much she misses her mother, the food she cooks and the comfort of home. She misses her brother. She wants to spend time with them. But for everything and anything that she wants to do, she has to first seek permission.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
                        	<blockquote> “I miss my home. my village. They don’t let me go. They tell me it hasn’t been long since my last visit. I miss my mother the most, the food she cooked and living with her".</blockquote>
                        </div>

                        <p>To those around her, Usha is not a child. She is a bride.</p>
 
						<p>Marriage should only take place between adults, she says. “If two people aren’t matured, it leads to misunderstandings that can lead to a failed marriage. Initially, my husband and I had our differences. We were complete strangers.”</p>
						 
						<p>After a year of living with him, Usha says she is now comfortable enough to call him by his name, "Mohalal Regar*"</p>
						 
						<p>Her face lights up when she is asked about her favourite TV shows and films. She recalls watching the film Border on TV and watching her favourite TV character ACP Pradyuman from CID, a crime investigation show. She talks about how she loves the thrill of watching a crime mystery be solved.</p>

						<p>Does she want to study further? I want to become a teacher, she says, reluctantly. A job that will allow her to balance her studies with her household responsibilities.</p>

						<p>But the decision is not hers to make. Will she get to become a teacher, like she wants?</p>

                        <h1 class="quintlab-details__content--headline">Band, Baaja & Police Scrutiny</h1>

                        <p>Band, Baaja and a Baraat that shouldn't have been. <strong>17-year-old</strong> Deep* sat atop a horse, decked in wedding finery as his baraat danced around him. With around 2,000 people, the baraat was a lively and noisy affair, until someone suddenly tugged at the horse to make it go in a different direction. The baraat quickly dispersed from the main road into a narrower gully. This may seem unusual, but not if you’re a child-groom, trying to escape police scrutiny.</p>
 
						<p>The family got a whiff of the police raid and hurriedly dispersed, with Deep's father-in-law helping him change out of his sherwani into a simple shirt and pant before proceeding to the wedding venue.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-second-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
						 
						<p>Recalling the night, Deep's family say they just managed to escape the “embarrassment” of being caught by the police. Deep's wedding, was after all, the first wedding of his generation.</p>
						 
						<div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
							<blockquote>“Everyone around here knows that child marriage is illegal. Aanganwadi workers come and tell us to not marry early. I didn’t want to but then aage na peeche shaadi toh karni thi. (I had to wed sooner or later). But it is acceptable in our samaj (society) as we would not get girls our age later," says Deep. "Sometimes, families wed off two or three daughters at the same time to reduce expenses," he says.</blockquote>
						</div>
						 
						<p>Deep says he was allowed to meet his bride-to-be, a student of Class 9, before their formal engagement. This was a rare luxury denied to many other children from his community, who meet their soon-to-be spouses only on the day of the wedding. But Deep says he got to meet the child bride and chat with her – while being chaperoned by an older relative.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
                            <blockquote>"I told my parents I will not agree to the wedding without seeing her. I then visited her place with my cousin. I got to see her on the terrace of her house, talk to her and then agreed to the marriage”.</blockquote>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-second-2.jpg" alt=""></div>

						<p>Had Deep's wife asked that she be allowed to meet him, she would not not have been allowed to. She wasn’t even asked if she wanted to marry him, says Deep, laughing at the possibility of her being allowed to see him (on her request).  He has a phone of his own and he uses it to stay in touch with his wife.</p>

                        <p>However, she isn't "allowed" to own a phone, he says. "She cannot not own a phone because in our society if a girl has a phone she invites 'shanka'. She is judged and her character is questioned. Even if she uses the phone to talk to her husband, people question her character. In our society, it is better for girls to not be open about their relationships". Not just his wife, Deep says, his sisters aren't allowed phones of their own either.</p>
						
                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--iframe">

                        </div>

						<p>Deep and his teenage bride will live together once she turns 18, as per the community's norms. After school, Deep wants to pursue a two-year course in Mechanical Training that will open up employment opportunities for him. His wife, on the other hand, will become a stay-at-home wife after her graduation, he says.</p>
						 
						<p>What makes an ideal marriage? “If a girl and boy know each other and like each other, then their parents should meet. If their parents like each other, only then should they marry each other.”   Will he explain this to his family, we ask. "Never! To stay in the samaj, you have to marry young".</p>
						 
                    </div>

                        <h1 class="quintlab-details__content--headline">‘I Picked My Bride, But...’</h1>

                        <p>Seventeen year old Amresh Khatik* exudes confidence as he shoos away the other boys who had gathered in the classroom, and prepares himself for the interview. He beams brightly as he informs us that he is engaged and will tie the knot this summer. Amresh shows us a photo of his fiancée on his phone. But when his friends ask to see the photo, he turns them down in a stern manner.</p>
						 
						<div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
							<blockquote>“The girl's side sent us the marriage proposal. Her parents saw me at a function that I had attended with my parents. My father did a background check, liked her family and the alliance was made.”</blockquote>
						</div>
						 
						<p>Teenagers like Amresh in Rajasthan have come to accept their fate – they are conditioned to believe that child marriage is a part of their tradition. The patriarchal society that defines gender roles is a part of the package that they inherit. "There aren't enough girls here. Parents of girls marry them young, and so when the boys grow up, we don't find girls our age to marry. I didn't get to choose a girl of my liking, but at least I'll get to marry someone"</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-third-1.jpg" alt=""></div>
						 
						<p>When asked, locals in his town of Bhadesar say that child marriage helps control sexuality in the young and protect their "honour", besides being economical. Community members are almost unanimous in the belief that it is harder to find a match after a certain age.</p>

						<p>Amresh explains:  "When two people are married off at a young age, they do not get a life partner of their choice. I don't get a girl of my liking. The two may not be able to live happily, there's bound to be fights and misunderstandings. Marriages tend to break up. But you can always remarry".</p>
						 
						<p>His response gives us a sneak peak into the parallel worlds that exist in the town of Bhadesar – one that the girls live in, and one that the boys live in. Amresh speaks to his fiancée every now and then. But he has a phone of his own, while she uses her mother's number.</p>

						<p>When he asked his parents to buy him a phone, Amresh told his father that he would use it to complete his homework, and watch videos. When he finished his Class 10, he was given a Samsung Z3 Pro, which cost Rs 8,000 at that time. I watched films like Baahubali and Judwaa 2 on my phone, he says, adding that his elder sister does not have a phone of her own.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--iframe">
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZShsV53JLWg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>

						<p>Amresh's father is a farmer, but he says that after his Class 12, he wants to  do a diploma from ITI, an institute for skill development.</p>

						<div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
							<blockquote> "Parents think I am old enough to marry. They started talking about my marriage in front of me and I felt shy. When they asked me if I liked her, I was so shy that I started laughing".</blockquote>
						</div>
						 
						<p>While Amresh was asked if he liked his family's choice of a bride, she was not given an option, he says with a faint sense of pride. The marriage is now days away and Amresh says he feels a lot of pressure. “My parents want this marriage more than me. I am not even mentally ready. What if we don’t get along? Anything can happen,” he says.</p>

                        <p>Anju Jhat* is 17 and married, currently living with her parents. She will move in with her in-laws when she is 18.</p>

						<p>"My" Prakash, she says, referring to her now 20-year-old husband, calls her from time to time on the phone, and that remains their only mode of communication. She doesn’t have a personal phone because girls aren’t allowed to have one. While she might remain sceptical at the thought of moving to her in-laws’ after she turns eighteen, she has come to accept that it will be a reality, and is unwilling to question the practice.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--media"><img src="assets/images/story/story-forth-1.jpg" alt=""></div>

						<p>Daughter of a farmer, Anju was tied to the institution of marriage when she turned thirteen. That summer, when school was closed for vacation, she was married off to a 16-year-old boy from Udaipur.</p>

						<p>However, Asha wasn’t the only person in her family who got married at that time. Her older brother and her two cousins also got married the same week as her. The marriage celebrations lasted for seven days, but, “I didn’t like anything”, says Asha rather reluctantly.</p>

						<div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
							<blockquote>“In our society girls aren’t told whom they are marrying, or even about their own marriage. Parents pick their partner and just inform you. It is not a good feeling to get married at 13." – Anju Jhat</blockquote>
						</div>

						<p>Hailing from a village near Bhadesar, she firmly believes in the concept of “justice for all” and says that men and women should be treated equally by law.</p>

                        <div class="quintlab-details__content--iframe">
                            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JVrziU3x48" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        </div>

						<p>Her favourite subject is political science, and she aspires to wear the black coat and fight for justice as a lawyer one day. Asha is vociferous about her dream and asserts that education alone improves life. The volume of her voice is turned down several notches when the conversation veers from her aspirations to her marriage.</p>

						<p>As someone who believes in justice, should child marriage happen at all? Unwilling to question the practice, she is nervous about responding, but says:</p>

						<div class="quintlab-details__content--quote">
							<blockquote>“It is wrong and it shouldn’t happen but in Rajasthan child marriage is a tradition”</blockquote>
						</div>

						<p>Will Anju eventually don a lawyer’s court and fight for justice in the court? Will she be bound by marriage to quit college? Will she even make it to college?</p>

						<p>Even after the ban, child marriage continues to jeopardise girls’ future. While a boy even after marriage continues to pursue his education and get a job, girls are told to look after the house. Instead of protecting girls’ 'honour', it is time the region debates with passion how the future of girls like Asha hangs on a balance.</p>
