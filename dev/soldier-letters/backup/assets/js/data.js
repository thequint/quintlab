A lot of news shown on TV is true but a lot of it is false. So don't believe in it completely, just believe in God. We will all be home soon. Do write to me about how the wedding was and how the Siliguri trip went.</p><p>Captain Durani (who was in 891) and Major R K Malhotra, both are in the same area and were remembering you a lot. The 158 Med (Corps) from Meerut is also here. Two of its officers’ families are in S N Park. I talk to Colonel S P Singh everyday. Tell Mrs S P that he is okay.</p><p>Write to me whenever you find the chance. Make sure to enroll Neha into tuition classes. Where is Panditji and his family now? Are they going to shift or not? If possible, ask their daughter  to tutor Neha. How is Mona? She must be back from Bombay by now. When is she getting married?</p><p>I will write in detail in the next letter. Take care of yourself.</p><p>With love,<br>Yours Truly,<br>Chandra</p><p></p><p>Dear Chinki,</p><p>I received your letter. Thanks for encouraging us. Do not entirely believe the TV &amp; radio, as everything is fair in love and war. We hope to come back soon.</p> <p>The subject taken by you has a lot of scope. However, to make a career</p><p>out of it, you must understand the subject well and should be able to do well in your studies. In this field, sky is the limit.</p> <p>Do keep writing, it keeps us flying high.</p><p>With best wishes,</p><p>Yours,<br>Mama</p>",

Ask him to get a good camera with built in 300 m and built in or separate flash if they are at a cheaper rate than at Dhulabari. The total cost should not be more than Rs 7,000 (including excise duty). Tell mummy I sold my camera &amp; flash for Rs 4,500.</p><p>With love,<br>Your Daddy</p>",

When I went to get a ticket for you, I found out that you have cancelled your program to go to Muzaffarpur. Please make the new program as you see fit. We are all fine; it will take us a few more days here. Please don’t worry about anything. They are sending Akhileshwar on leave from 2 June onwards. With him, I will send Uma Nandu’s warrant and a ‘Form D’ for you. If you plan to go to Muzaffarpur again, you can use it.</p> <p>Your company, albeit just for 12 hours, felt very good. We will meet again very soon.</p><p>We keep meeting Major P N Prasad and Major Dua. I asked Major P N to give you a call, he might have reached out to you.</p><p>Major Rajender is leaving for the Long Gunner Staff Course on 26 May.

			letter_text: "<p>Dear Papa,</p><p>Hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits. Thanks for your letter and card dated 14 June 1999.</p><p>I think you are right about *****. He does appear to be from the lower decks. Dubloo must be fine or else I would have come to know. We must understand that he must also be quite busy preparing for their share of the game.</p><p>We are also already getting ready for our next task. Our unit now has to live up to the higher expectations of the Army, Regt, as well as the media. You know what, even the Chief sent a letter of congratulations to the unit. It was indeed an honour for our unit to have been given such a task. Hard work and a sound ethos does have its merits, don't you think? We now have to work harder to preserve the hopes and aspirations  of our well wishers.</p><p>Please don't worry about casualties. It's a professional hazard which is beyond our control, so why worry; at least it's for a good cause. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna briefs Arjun on the following lines: Hato va prapyasi swargam, Jitva va bhokshijasey mahim, taduthisht kaunteya, yudhaya kritnishchayaha. ('Die and you will go to heaven; conquer and you enjoy sovereignty of the earth; therefore, stand up, Arjuna, and fight with determination.')</p><p>No, we are not air maintained, but the food is good and we have a Bengali doctor if not Chinese. Yes, the PM's Kargil visit was a good motivation. Good chap. I am quite a sight now with an unkempt beard and vaseline cream all over my ugly face to counter the icy winds.</p><p>Please tell manam that combat is an honour of a lifetime and I would not think of anything less. What better way to serve the nation? I am proud to be in the Infantry and especially in our illustrious battalion.</p><p>Take care of your health as well as manam's. Don't worry and lose sleep. Tell a story a day from The Mahabharata to Charu, so that your grandchild imbibes good values.</p><p>Jai Mataji ki.</p><p>Yours affly,<br>Babloo<br>19 June 1999</p>",
