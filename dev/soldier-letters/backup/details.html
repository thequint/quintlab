          <p><strong>Rank: </strong>Major<br>
            <strong>Regiment: </strong>315 Field Regiment<br>
            <strong>Awards: </strong>Sena Medal (Posthumous)</p>
          <p>Major CB Dwivedi was all of 20 when he joined the Army in 1981. He was commissioned into the Regiment of Artillery as a gunner.</p>
          <p>His unit, the 315 Field Regiment, was the first artillery unit to be deployed in Drass in the initial phase of the Kargil War on 14 May 1999. Major Dwivedi and his men were responsible for supporting the operations of four other regiments, who went on to capture Tololing, Point 5140, Black Tooth, Tiger Hill and Gun Hill from the enemy. Between 14 and 31 May, the unit went through an incredibly difficult period as they had to fire at one location and constantly keep moving to the next one in order to avoid detection. They were responsible for the safety of the infantry units, and were often faced with two choices at night – to either stop firing and wait for dawn, or to keep firing to protect the infantry. Major Dwivedi always chose the latter to provide a constant shield for his fellow men.</p>
          <p>He faced the same choice on 2 July: to continue firing or to stop. Two infantry units (18 grenadier and 8 Sikh) would have been in grave danger had they stopped. As second-in-command, Major Dwivedi chose to put the units’ safety over his and motivated his men to keep firing at the enemy all night, with him at the gunner’s position on top of the artillery gun.</p>
          <p>That evening, a shell landed right next to him. His arm was hit and some of the shrapnel entered his body from the side. He continued to fire until his last breath, even though he was bleeding profusely.</p>
          <p>Even when he was on the field, Major CB Dwivedi was a family man through and through. He planned his holidays around his children’s exams and aided his wife in chores, from paying the bills to getting train tickets confirmed for her travels – all while posted in a war zone.</p>

          <p>Much is talked about what it is to be a soldier defending the country behind enemy lines, but have you ever given a thought to what it is to be the ones waiting at home? Waiting for good news, a phone call, a letter, for the war to end...just waiting? Major Chandu Dwivedi's wife, Bhawna and eldest daughter, Neha, narrate their story or the part they played in the Kargil War, ever encouraging, ever waiting for their soldier to come home victorious and safe. From the time Major Dwivedi left for the war to the time they received his last letter after they had completed his last rites to the emptiness that remains 19 years since...what tremors of Kargil were felt all the way in a small home in Meerut? </p>

            <p>What do I say about my husband? However much I say about his personality will be less. They say that God calls good people from this world earlier back to him. He was very caring...as a son, brother, father or the best husband. He was obviously a good soldier as well. He sacrificed his life for the nation. I feel very proud of my husband. Even my children do.</p>
            <p>He left for Kargil on 14 May. We never spoke in person after that. We reached Srinagar on 13 May and the next day he and his men moved from there. We were together for 12 hours. In his last letter, even he mentions that the time we spent in those 12 hours was really memorable. But...I didn’t get to know only...when I met him and when he was gone. That’s the only regret I have. That perhaps I could’ve said something...what I had to say to him, we couldn’t even finish the conversation and he left us.</p>
            <p>Since he left for the war, there were no phone calls from him initially. We used to live in Meerut. I used to get no phone call and get really worried. Sometimes I would pray, sometimes I would keep crying. Some of my friends would come over and tell me ‘why are you crying? Because everything is fine, that is why you haven’t received a call. Getting a call means there’s been a problem. That’s why don’t worry, everything will be fine. He will be back soon.’</p>
            <p>I’m from Bihar, so we had to travel from Meerut to Bihar once. So I went and spent one month there. On 21 June, he called for the first time. I wasn’t home, I was at someone’s house. We didn’t have mobile phones then. I was called back home and I spoke to him. He had a habit of giving the phone to whoever was sitting next to him...friend, fellow army men...he would say talk to them, everyone lives alone and likes to talk to family and friends back home. I would complain that he himself talks less to me and makes me talk to others more. That day he couldn’t speak to the kids. He said that he’ll talk to me when I reach Siliguri, where I was going next.</p>
            <p>After I reached Siliguri, I would sit at the PCO everyday and wait to talk to him. When I received no call, I would feel very dejected and go back home. This was my daily routine for the week I was there.</p>
            <p>Then on 30 June, he called. I picked up and couldn’t believe it was him on the other end. I was wondering has he really called me? Am I imagining this? That’s how I was feeling. Anyway, it was him and we started talking. But his voice...felt very heavy for some reason. It could be that he had an idea of some problem brewing...he was talking to me, so he must also be feeling it more. But he kept talking to me. My sister was sitting right next to me. I gave her the phone and asked her to talk to him saying that I found the way he was talking very worrying. She started talking to him and asking him how he was etc. He then told her: “Tell Bhawna that whatever news she sees on TV is half truth, half lies. Ask her not to believe that. Tell her not to worry, we will all come back definitely.” </p>
            <p>That was it. He asked to speak to the kids. He spoke to Neha, our elder daughter but by the time Diksha could get to the phone, it had gotten disconnected. We kept trying to call him back, maybe he was trying too...but we couldn’t speak again that day. I do remember he said at the end to me that he will speak to me once I return to Meerut.</p>
            <p>On 2 July, we left for Meerut. On 3 July, when we reached Delhi on the way, my brother who was also in the Army and was posted there, had come to the station with my sister’s son. They all came and started insisting that I come back home with them. They said that we had travelled a lot, and I should have some lunch and rest before continuing towards Meerut. Everyone was insisting so much, so I had to go. We went, sat down...my sister-in-law had made tea. I had a sip...I didn’t feel like doing anything but I sat there for sometime with them nevertheless.</p>
            <p>Then my brother called me inside the room. My sister’s son was also there. All of them hugged me and my brother said ‘Chandrabhushan is no more’. I felt like...I couldn’t believe it...I still don’t know what to say. It felt like my entire world had collapsed. He spoke the words and I felt that...this was the end. There was nothing left for me. There’s no reason to live life anymore.</p>
            <p>Then my brother asked me to look at our two daughters and explained to me that if I gave up like this, what would they do? I looked at my daughters. Even they got worried looking at me and slowly they also found out about the news.</p>
            <p>Then..what was there? Just the wait...when will he come back? When will his body come to us? He had to come on the 3rd, but he couldn’t and his remains arrived on 4 July. Then, we left for Bihar from here after that.</p>
            <p>Then we returned from Bihar to Meerut, because we had to pack everything before moving to Delhi where I had decided to stay till my daughters’ education was over. So, when we reached Meerut, one of his letters he had written on 30 June had arrived late. By the time I got the letter, everything was already over. In the letter, he wrote about everyone as usual...he is here, he is there...that was his letter. He had written to everyone...our daughters, to me, and even to a niece I have.</p>
            <p>What was next? Nothing. Just had to look at our daughters and live somehow. We shifted to Delhi and got their admissions done. My elder daughter, Neha was 12 then and in the 8th grade. Diksha, was eight-years-old and in the 3rd grade. So, their schools began. Slowly, they grew up. Neha did her MBBS, Diksha studied journalism. Today, she’s an author and has also written a book on her father called ‘Letters from Kargil’.</p>
            <p>That’s it...when I came to Delhi, I got a petrol pump [from the government]. That’s what I run now. In the beginning, there were a lot of problems...I still have them till this day. Only recently it has begun feeling like it’s getting better. Because I was a housewife, I had no knowledge about everything. My husband would do everything for me, I would just follow him. I had no idea. We ran into a lot of financial problems...our money got stuck in the market. But it’s getting better.</p>
            <p>When someone dies, only the person who is left behind knows how difficult it is to handle that pain. We know that pain really well. Even today, the kids really remember him a lot. He was always laughing and playing with them. If I was ever traveling my train alone, he used to make an entire map detailing which station comes where and when do that I can pass the time by looking at the map. Just like this, he had always pampered me a lot. He never let me have a problem about anything. I remember all that...no one can do as much as my husband did. Even though he had such a busy schedule, he would never not write to us. Even though he was at a place where it was tough to write letters, even if he wrote two lines, he would write them and send it to us.</p>
            <p>These are the few memories we have of him. We have to live with the support of these memories only now. We have to live ahead. </p>
            <p>This is it. This is my story. </p>

          <div class="scrol-text">
            <p>When I think about my father, the first thing that comes in front of my eyes is his ever smiling face. I don’t think I ever saw him with a frown, even when we would go to Srinagar where he would be at his busiest. One of the main things that I have learnt from him is also how much of his heart and soul he would put into every job that he would do. Like for example, he would help me with my studies. So just to explain and give a better idea to me about say, a ray diagram or a pinhole camera...he made sure he would buy those small concave and convex mirrors to make those ray diagrams and give me an idea as to why it works the way it does. Or made a pinhole camera at home to show me, so that my concepts are clear. I had no idea at that time, or even till now who would go to those lengths?</p>
            <p>And besides that, he used to plan his leaves according to our exams, just so that he could be around. But it’s not like when he came here he would only focus on us. He would focus on our mother too. So typically, his day would begin like this: he would wake up in the morning and make sure if anything needed to be done around the house, he’d do all that. Then he’d sit with us, he’d make us study. Then, my mom was very fond of going to to the club...we had something every Saturday or Wednesday or something...and he would make sure she’s happy, she goes there. He had a scooter that time, so he would drop her there, come back, make me finish my studies, and then take Diksha and me both and go back to the club. Then we would all have dinner together and get back.</p>
            <p>You know one would think that he’s on leave and he should be just chilling and having a fun time and probably resting. But no, that man from the time he woke up to the time he slept, would just be roaming and making circles around the women of the house and just keeping everyone was happy. The one thing that he probably gave to me is that he raised my standards really high.</p>
            <p>When we met for the last time, it wasn't really supposed to obviously the last time that we were going to meet him. We had gone to spend our summer vacations with him [on 13 June] which was a summer ritual for us. But strangely this particular time when we had reached...he had come to pick us up, but the minute we reached we were told that we had to go back since he and his men had to go up because apparently the war was declared. But I don't think he said that. He just probably said that there's some disturbance there and I'll have to go. Of course we remember that we were sad about it...Diksha and I, as much as we could understand. Strangely from the time he picked us up from the transit camp, I had no recollection of what happened till early in the morning the next day [on 14 June] when he was leaving. I remember Diksha and I were sleeping. My mother must've been up since before and we were both woken up and my mum said 'Daddy's leaving. Say bye to him.' I remember we woke up all sleepy and groggy and hugged him and he just left after that.</p>
            <p>I remember thinking about it later that you know...I wish I had known. That this would be the last...this is so unfair...was this the last time? Was that supposed to be the last time? Why didn't I have the slightest idea? I wish I would have known so I could have made that hug a little longer...I could have tried and stayed up a little longer...gotten up a little earlier to spend some more time with him. I mean...I know it sounds very irrational right now but at that time, when something like this happens, that's the first thing you think. It was so unfinished...like we just couldn't do what we should have or were supposed to do. So, it was really emotional that time, more because we were really saddened by the fact that you know...we were always really excited about our summer vacations but for us they just suddenly ended the minute they started.</p>
            <p>His last letter we received after we'd got the news and we came back to Meerut and we'd gone back to Bihar. All the rituals were done, all the decisions were taken and we had come back to Meerut to pack and shift where Mummy had decided to shift, which was Delhi. So when we reached back, there was a letter there which he had probably written earlier and it was waiting for us at home. </p>
            <p>It was...for me, I kept thinking...I used to really struggle with myself to kind of accept the fact that he's not there. I used to struggle with myself because I used to keep thinking...you know, I just hope that I wake up one day and get to know that this was a dream. I would pray so hard to God that I wish that I wake up tomorrow and get to know that I have just been dreaming or all this was just a confusion or there was some mistake and it's not him, it was someone else or any of those things. I kept thinking...can we rewind time? Can we rewind time somehow? Can something else change the story because this story needs to be changed because this can't be true. I can't remember till what time I kept thinking like that. So when we received his letter...he had written things like 'don't believe the news...don't believe the TV...they don't always show the right thing, they over exaggerate...' You know, reading it at that time was so ironic because it was like....you're lying, we know you're lying. It's just...it's an inexplicable feeling. I am not sure I can put it in the right words. We probably should have felt great to receive one of his last letters...something that we were not expecting, but it was also very tough to accept it. </p>

          <p><strong>Rank: </strong>Major<br>
            <strong>Regiment: </strong>2 Rajputana Rifles<br>
            <strong>Awards: </strong>Maha Vir Chakra (Posthumous) </p>
          <p>Major Padmapani Acharya was an officer in the Indian Army’s 2 Rajputana Rifles. Originally from Odisha, he was a resident of Hyderabad, Telangana. He joined the Indian Army in 1994.</p>
          <p>On 21 June 1999, his family consisting of his six-month pregnant wife, brother and parents celebrated his birthday at home. One week later, on 28 June 1999, in the battalion attack on Tololing by the 2nd Rajputana Rifles, Major Acharya as a Company Commander was given the task of capturing a heavily fortified enemy bunker, strongly held with minefields and machine gun and artillery fire. Tololing was a dominant position overlooking the Srinagar-Leh Highway; its successful capture would have been pivotal to India winning the Kargil war.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the troop suffered a large number of casualties due to heavy artillery attack by Pakistan in the early stages itself. But this did not stop Major Acharya. He went forward with the mission leading the reserve platoon, unmindful of his own safety. Some of his men were injured, but he encouraged them to keep moving towards their goal. He himself crawled up to the enemy bunker and threw several grenades at them. When he was gravely injured, he commanded his men to leave him and continue the attack on the enemy; he too continued firing. After a whole night of intense hand-to-hand battle, 2 Rajputana Rifles succeeded in recapturing Tololing, turning the course of the Kargil war. Unfortunately, Major Acharya succumbed to his injuries soon after.</p>
          <p>Back home, his family was given the news and told that Major Acharya “fought bravely. He created history but he is no more".</p>

          <p>It can be quite hard putting into words the feeling of losing a husband and that too, in active combat. So, we asked Charulata Acharya, Major Acharya's wife, two simple questions: what has life been like for the last 19 years and what these letters meant to her when she received them. Succintly, she tugs at our heartstrings with words that will still never be able to convey the true magnitude of her loss and pride. </p>

          <p>I miss him a lot. I wish he was there for me and our daughter. There are milestones that would not have been so tough to cross had he been there. Nevertheless, I believe he has taken care of us even from the beyond. </p>
          <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Q.2 What was it like receiving these letters from him while he was posted in Kargil? </strong></p>

          <p>He was at war. It was very tense. Everyday we would sit with our hearts in our mouths, praying for not only him, but for every soldier out there. As a son of the soil, he was responsible for the safety and security of the nation, yet in his letters we see that he did not forget his responsibility towards his family. And though he is not with us, he continues to take care of every need we have or will have. I believe that this young generation should try and imbibe this quality.</p>

        <div class="article-text"> <a class="btn-goback" href="index.html#destination">Go Back</a>
          <h3 class="article-sub-headline">Background</h3>
          <p><strong>Rank: </strong>Lieutenant, promoted to Captain posthumously<br>
            <strong>Regiment: </strong>4th Battalion, Jat Regiment</p>
          <p>Captain Saurabh Kalia was born in Amritsar in 1976 and completed his entire education till graduation in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh. At the young age of 21 and standing at 6 feet 2 inches, he joined the Indian Military Academy in 1997. He was almost immediately posted in the 4 JAT Regiment (Infantry) in the Kargil Sector which he joined in January 1999.</p>
          <p>Trouble was already brewing. In the last fortnight of May 1999, Captain Saurabh went out on Patrol duty thrice. He is hailed as the first office to provide detailed intelligence about Pakistan’s large-scale intrusion into Kargil.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/saurabh-kalia/kalia-piping.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>The fourth time Patrol Duty came up, Captain Saurabh volunteered to go in place of another slightly older officer. With five other soldiers, he went to Bajrang Post at the height of 14,000 feet in the Kaksar area where his group faced heavy firing from the Pakistan army. They returned fire and held their posts until they ran out of ammunition and their signal equipment went out of order. They were captured on 15 May 1999 and kept in captivity for twenty two days without informing India about their Prisoner of War status. When Pakistan returned their bodies on 9 June, it was clear that they had been brutally tortured: broken teeth and bones, punctured eyes, cigarette burns, chopped off limbs and finally a fatal gun wound. But they didn’t give in and reveal any information that was demanded of them. </p>
          <p>Captain’s Saurabh’s parents never got the opportunity to actually see him in a uniform since he was sent to war so soon after training. He became a martyr before his last salary arrived in his bank account, before he could see himself become a Captain. He gave his life in what came to be known as Operation Vijay, named after his mother, Vijay Kalia. </p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/saurabh-kalia/kalia-mother.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>His last words to this mother before going to Kargil were: <em><strong>“Maa, tum dekhna. Ek din aisa kaam kar jaoonga ki saari duniya mein mera naam hoga.”</strong></em> (Maa, you see, one day I will do such a deed that the whole world will know my name).</p>

          <p>Saurabh’s family of three still lives in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, twenty years since they received this letter. His 70-year-old father, Dr N K Kalia retired as a senior scientist in the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research at the Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology. His mother, Mrs Vijaya is a 66-year-old homemaker. Saurabh’s brother, whose school examinations he inquires about in his letter, has since then passed school and college and now works as a software engineer at the Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University. </p>
          <p>For the past nineteen years, Dr Kalia has been fighting for justice for his son. He feels that the torture and murder of his son should be declared a war crime by the United Nations. He has been garnering massive support for his online petition urging the Indian government to take Pakistan to the International Court of Justice at The Hague for their actions. The case is also pending in the Supreme Court of India. </p>

          <p><strong>Rank: </strong>Captain<br>
            <strong>Regiment:</strong> 2 Rajputana Rifles<br>
            <strong>Awards:</strong> Vir Chakra (Posthumous) </p>
          <p>Vijayant Thapar was born into an Army family. His great-grandfather, his grandfather and his father all served in the Indian Army, so it was easy for him to decide what he wanted to do in life. From a young age, he would take his father’s peak cap, his cane and march around like a soldier. One of his parents’ earliest memories is of him running around in the garden with their two dogs, chasing butterflies and doing mock charges on friendly langoors. Vijayant worked hard to realise this dream and was eventually selected for the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vijayant-thapar/vijayant-ima-group-2.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>He was commissioned on 12 December 1998 and joined the 2 Rajputana Rifles at Gwalior. After several counter terrorist operations, his unit was ordered to move to Drass to capture Tololing, Tiger Hill and adjoining heights. On 28 June, 2 Rajputana Rifles was given the task of capturing Tololing, Three Pimples, Knoll and Lone Hill area.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vijayant-thapar/vijayant-regiment.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>Again, Pakistan had all the advantages: a full moon night, strongly prepared positions, one narrow ridge, precipitous slopes on both sides, ravines thousands of feet deep, no cover and almost vertical climbs at places. The attack began and soon there was intense artillery shelling and enemy fire. Still, he, along with his troop, continued to move through a ravine towards their destination. At 8 PM that night, 120 guns opened fire. Undeterred, Captain Thapar led his team into this inferno. Somehow, the company secured a foothold on Knoll. Around this time, Captain Thapar heard the news of his company commander Major P Acharya being killed in the Battle of Tololing. This angered him like no other and along with his colleague Naik Tilak Singh, he starting engaging with the enemy from as close as 15 meters. He fought against two machine guns directly firing at him for an hour and a half after which he decided to move up and kill the enemy from closer range. Just then, a burst of fire struck him and he fell into the arms of Tilak Singh.  He was only 22-years-old.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vijayant-thapar/vijayant-friend.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>After this, his men charged ahead and fully captured Knoll, giving the Indian Army yet another of its decisive victories in the Kargil War. </p>

His life...whatever he could do in his short life, he's done more than that. Really, I feel very small in front of my son.</p>

        <div class="article-text"> <a class="btn-goback" href="index.html#destination">Go Back</a>
          <h3 class="article-sub-headline">Background</h3>
          <p><strong>Rank: </strong>Captain<br>
            <strong>Regiment: </strong>13th Jammu and Kashmir Rifles<br>
            <strong>Award: </strong>Param Vir Chakra (Posthumous)</p>
          <p>Vikram Batra was born in Palampur in 1974. Vikram, who was born 14 minutes before his twin, Vishal, had always been a patriotic overachiever. So, it seemed only natural to his family when he decided to prepare for his Combined Defense Services (CDS) degree. He cleared it with flying colours, joined the Indian Military Academy and was commissioned as a lieutenant. His first posting was in Jammu and Kashmir’s Baramullah district.</p>
          <p>Right before the Kargil war broke out, Vikram was on leave to celebrate Holi with his family in Palampur. When a friend asked him to be careful now that the war had begun, Captain Batra said: “Don’t worry. I’ll either come back after raising the Indian flag in victory or return wrapped in it, but I will come for sure”.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vikram-batra/vikram-quote-1.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>He then reported for duty at Kargil on 1 June 1999. Eighteen days later, he was ordered to recapture Point 5140 in his first major battle. Vikram led his men to a tactical victory and strengthened India’s hold on the territory. After reaching the top of the steep cliff, Vikram famously told his commander at the base: “Ye Dil Maange More!”</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vikram-batra/vikram-portrait.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>His next major battle was to capture the 17,000 feet high Point 4875 – arguably one of the toughest mountain warfare campaigns during the Kargil war. The icy slopes were 80 degrees steep and covered in fog; Pakistan had positioned themselves at 16,000 feet.</p>
          <p>On 7 July, Vikram and his men began their climb to fortify the territory. Pakistan got wind of the fact that Sher Shah (Vikram’s code name) was fast approaching and intensified their attack from above.</p>
          <div class="article-landscape"> <img src="assets/data/vikram-batra/vikram-regiment.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>Vikram led the counter-attack and shocked the enemy into retreating, by engaging in fearless hand-to-hand combat and motivating his men to keep moving forward.</p>
          <p>The mission was almost over when a junior officer was injured in an explosion. Vikram ran to rescue him amidst heavy fire. When his subedar said that he would go in his stead, Vikram said: <em><strong>“Tu baal-bacchedar hain, hat ja peeche.”</strong></em> (You have children, step aside)”.</p>
          He kept moving towards his injured lieutenant, killing five soldiers in close combat. He was just about to lift his mate when a bullet hit his chest,
          <p>killing him. By morning, India had successfully recaptured Peak 4875, now called Vikram Batra Top as homage to the soldier's invaluable contribution to India’s victory.</p>
          <div class="article-portrait"> <img src="assets/data/vikram-batra/vikram-point4875.jpg" alt=""> </div>
          <p>Interestingly, Captain Batra had been offered a very well-paying job in the merchant navy by a Hong Kong firm, but he turned it down, telling his mother: “Money is not everything in life; I have to do something bigger in life, something great, something extraordinary, for my country.</p>

          <p>For India, Captain Vikram Batra had an unflinching love. But there’s another side to the braveheart, who sacrificed his life during the Kargil War to defend the nation and his fellow soldiers.</p>
          <p>Meet his then girlfriend – Dimple Cheema.</p>
          <p>Dimple spoke to The Quint about the first time she met Vikram. When they were introduced at Punjab University in 1995, little did Dimple know that it was just the beginning of a beautiful story that would stay with her forever.</p>

          <p>Speaking to The Quint, Vishal narrates the story of their childhood, helping us understand what really goes into making a hero like the Sher Shah of Kargil.</p>
