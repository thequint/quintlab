The fact that stalking is still a bailable offence in our country allows stalkers to get bail without serious scrutiny. This often puts the survivors at risk of facing acid attacks, rape, and even murder.</p><p>Stalking as a separate offence did not exist in the IPC till 2013. This necessarily affects any analysis of the statistics relating to stalking, as the National Crime Records Bureau (\u201CNCRB\u201D) only has statistical data for the years 2014-2016. Despite this, the data available paints an interesting picture of the nature of the crime and the way it is being dealt with in the country.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong> <strong>:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thequint.com/neon/aap-passes-bill-to-make-stalking-non-bailable-offence-the-quint-impact\">AAP Passes Resolution to Make Stalking Non-Bailable Offence</a></p><ul><li>In 2014, nearly 4,700 cases of stalking were reported. This jumped to 6,300 in 2015 \u2013 a 33% increase. In 2016, nearly 7,200 cases were reported. Given that awareness about the offence is still nascent and society still tends to view stalking as not too serious an offence, such high numbers, with increases every year, indicate how prevalent the crime really is.<br></li><li>Pendency rates for trials are high. In 2016, 13,449 cases were pending trial for stalking, out of which trial was completed in only 1,534 cases i.e. 11.4%. This leaves a huge backlog of trials to be carried forward into the new year.<br></li><li>In terms of the number of cases reported each year, only 3% in 2014, 5% in 2015 and 5% in 2016 resulted in convictions. In terms of trials, the conviction rate was 35% in 2014, but dropped to 26% in 2015 and stood at 26.4% in 2016.<br></li><li>Importantly, the data indicates a lower-than-normal incidence of false cases. The NCRB\u2019s statistics show that of the 9,800 stalking cases investigated by the police in the year, only 215 were found by them to be false.
